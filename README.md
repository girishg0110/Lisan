# Lisan

Lisan (pron. lee-saan) uses collaborative storytelling to fill the market gap in intermediate-level language learning services. Users will develop professional competency in an international language (like English, Arabic, French, etc...) by writing a story with Claude. Feedback on vocabulary and grammar will be provided, and new words will be logged for export into online flashcard services like Anki and Quizlet.
